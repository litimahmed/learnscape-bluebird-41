## "For Business" - Simple Explanation

**What it is:** A corporate training solution that helps companies train their employees online.

**Who it's for:**
- Companies that want to train their staff
- HR departments managing employee development
- Organizations needing compliance training

**What it offers:**
- **Team Management** - Organize employees into groups and assign courses
- **Progress Tracking** - See who completed what training and how they're doing
- **Custom Training Paths** - Create specific learning programs for different roles
- **Analytics** - Get reports on training effectiveness and completion rates
- **Compliance Training** - Ensure employees meet regulatory requirements

**Real-world examples:**
- New Employee Onboarding - Automatically assign training to new hires
- Skills Development - Upskill teams in new technologies or soft skills
- Leadership Training - Develop managers and executives
- Safety Training - Ensure workplace compliance and certifications

**The business model:**
- Monthly subscription per employee ($19-$59/month depending on features)
- Enterprise deals for large companies
- Free trials to get companies started

**Think of it like:** Netflix for corporate training - companies pay a monthly fee to give their employees access to professional courses and training programs, with admin tools to manage and track everything.

This targets the B2B market instead of individual learners, which typically means higher revenue per customer and more stable, long-term contracts.
